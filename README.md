# Battleship-sinking-game

**INTRODUCTION**<br/>
This game was developed for a project for my computer science studies.<br/>
The project has already been submitted and assessed, therefore it will not be developed further.<br/>

**INFORMATION**<br/>
The program is written in the C++ object-oriented language using the Allegro graphics library.<br/>
Some of the graphics used in the project are not ours. However, they were adapted to the needs of the project.<br/>
The same applies to any sounds and fonts that were used.<br/>

**INSTRUCTION**<br/>
PLACE THE SHIP / SHOOT -  LEFT MOUSE BUTTON<br/>
ROTATE THE SHIP        -  RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON

Thank you for your attention.
