# Battleship-sinking-game

**INTRODUCTION**
This game was developed by a team of 3 for a project for my computer science studies. 
The project has already been submitted and assessed, therefore it will not be developed further.

**INFORMATION**
The program is written in the C++ object-oriented language using the Allegro graphics library. 
Some of the graphics used in the project are not ours. However, they were adapted to the needs of the project. 
The same applies to any sounds and fonts that were used.

**INSTRUCTION**
PLACE THE SHIP / SHOOT -  LEFT MOUSE BUTTON
ROTATE THE SHIP        -  RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON


Thank you for your attention. :3
